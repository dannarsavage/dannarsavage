My public repos are primarily academic & simplistic for experimentation with a particular technology or technique, so it's unlikely you'll find anything especially compelling here. But I make them public to display some of my work, and I do try to keep them looking somewhat tidy with meaningful names for variables, methods, classes, etc; docstrings for all public members; concise but informative commit comments; efforts described in more detail in issues; and that sort of thing (though you'll find *plenty* of examples where I don't stick to those standards--I try, but I don't always succeed). So . . . Enjoy?
